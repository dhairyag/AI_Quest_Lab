# AI_Quest_Lab

A collection of AI-ML projects showcasing different applications and technologies.
Each project folder contains detailed documentation, setup instructions, and technical details in their respective README files.

## Projects

### 1. [Markdown Notes Chrome Extension](session_01_chrome_extension/README.md)
A Chrome extension built to capture and format web content in Markdown. Features text selection, formatting options, and note organization capabilities. Built with JavaScript and Chrome Extension APIs.

### 2. [Image and File Processor](session_02_web_FastAPI_app/README.md)
A web application for processing images and files, built with FastAPI backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. Provides a clean interface for file uploads and processing operations.

### 3. [DataAlchemy: Data Processing App](session_03_ML_data_processing_app/README.md)
A comprehensive FastAPI-based application for processing multiple data types (text, audio, image, 3D geometry). Features preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization capabilities. Built with FastAPI, PyTorch, and various data processing libraries.

### 4. [WebApp MNIST Monitor](session_04_web_app_mnist_monitor/README.md)
A real-time web-based monitoring system for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset. This system provides live updates on training progress, loss curves, and sample predictions through an intuitive web interface.

### 5. [MNIST CICD](https://github.com/dhairyag/MINIST_CICD)
A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for MNIST digit classification using PyTorch.
The project includes a robust CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions. All changes must pass the automated pipeline before deployment. 

### 6. [Tiny-MNIST with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dhairyag/tiny_MNIST)
This repository implements a CNN-based deep learning model for MNIST digit classification with automated architecture validation through GitHub Actions.
`main_mnist.py` uses only 3,130 parameters to achieve more than 99.4% accuracy, observed in multiple runs.

### 7. [MNIST Classification Experiments](https://github.com/dhairyag/multi_models_MNIST)
This repository contains experiments for classifying the MNIST dataset using different neural network architectures. The experiments are conducted in three Jupyter notebooks: `01_train_mnist.ipynb`, `02_train_mnist.ipynb`, and `03_train_mnist.ipynb`. Each notebook explores a different model architecture and training strategy.

### 8. [CIFAR10 Image Classification with Custom CNN](https://github.com/dhairyag/4blocks_CIFAR10)
This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for the CIFAR10 dataset classification task. The network achieves 85%+ accuracy while maintaining under 128k parameters through efficient architecture choices and modern convolution techniques.
